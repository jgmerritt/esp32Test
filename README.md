# esp32Test
-----
Testing program for ESP32 code under the Arduino Framework

This code is using an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, CY521 (MPU6050) accelormeter, and OLED display. I am testing
the functionality of the sensors before migrating to the ESP-IDF framework.

All work will eventually be used in my version of the SPOTmicro project
